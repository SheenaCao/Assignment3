    <h1>APCV403 Lab 3: Custom Font Integration</h1>
    <p>In this project, we are using a font called 'Lobster' that was initially sourced from Google Fonts. Instead of linking directly to Google Fonts, the font file has been downloaded and is now hosted on our own server. This method is known as self-hosting and it allows for more control over the font serving process. The @font-face rule in CSS is used to specify the location of the font file on our server, allowing the browser to download and use it when rendering our web page. This ensures that the font is available even if Google Fonts is not accessible for any reason, and it can also offer performance benefits by utilizing the same connection used to load other resources from our server.</p>
